- Which variables/coefficents provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  - Answer: Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance are the two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  - Answer: No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.  This is due to the p-value of the linear model being much smaller than the significance level.  This provides statistical evidence that the null hypothesis is not true.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - Answer: Yes, the linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes as the r-squared value is .715.  This means that there is a 71.5% chance that future data points will fit this model

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
